1.Studio_pointers.exe
2. It contains the program's name
3. returns exactly the same, but each character is in a separate line
4. reference cannot point to nul, only ailas different to address, must initialize
I think the reason is reference cannot change the element it points to
5. Worked the same way, no difference
6.I used two pointers: a points to the element string in argv and b refers to the character in *a
