4. x,y values should stay the same, but if we print out the values refenced by p, q it would be different
5. 1. Yes, it can. the pointers r,q are not constant int pointers. Will call version 2. if commented out it will run 
version 3, which matches what I expect
2. mySwap does the version 3. It matches what I expect because it is a constant pointer.
